Hello I am Pranav Adithya a normal VII grader that just wanted to explore libraries of python such as:
-> Tkinter
-> OpenCV
-> PIL
-> numpy

I just wanted to make photo editing easier and effective. I now just created a "DEMO" version you really can't save the image that you've edited but soon
I'll make a save button.
